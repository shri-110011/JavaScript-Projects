/* To serve static files such as images, CSS files, and JavaScript files, use the 
express.static built-in middleware function in Express.

express.static(root, [options])
The root argument specifies the root directory from which to serve static assets.

After setting up this middleware: app.use(express.static('static')); 

Now, you can load the files that are in the static directory:
http://localhost:3001/css/styles.css

To use multiple static assets directories, call the express.static middleware function 
multiple times:

app.use(express.static('public'))
app.use(express.static('files'))
Express looks up the files in the order in which you set the static directories with 
the express.static middleware function.

*/

// app.use() is used to create an application level middleware.
/* To create a virtual path prefix (where the path does not actually exist in the file 
system) for files that are served by the express. 
app.use('/static', express.static('public'))

Now, you can load the files that are in the public directory from the /static path prefix.
