/* Express is a routing and middleware web framework that has minimal functionality of its 
own: An Express application is essentially a series of middleware function calls.

Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the 
response object (res), and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s 
request-response cycle. The next middleware function is commonly denoted by a variable 
named next.

Middleware functions can perform the following tasks:

Execute any code.
Make changes to the request and the response objects.
End the request-response cycle.
Call the next middleware function in the stack.
If the current middleware function does not end the request-response cycle, it must call 
next() to pass control to the next middleware function. Otherwise, the request will be 
left hanging.

*/

/* Bind application-level middleware to an instance of the app object by using the 
app.use() and app.METHOD() functions, where METHOD is the HTTP method of the request that 
the middleware function handles (such as GET, PUT, or POST) in lowercase.
 */
/* This example shows a middleware function with no mount path. The function is executed 
every time the app receives a request. */
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log('Time:', Date.now())
  next()
});

/* This example shows a middleware function mounted on the /user/:id path. The function is 
executed for any type of HTTP request on the /user/:id path. */
// app.use('/user/:id', (req, res, next) => {
//     console.log('Request Type:', req.method)
//     next()
// });

/* This example shows a route and its handler function (middleware system). The function 
handles GET requests to the /user/:id path.
*/
// app.get('/user/:id', (req, res, next) => {
//     res.send('USER')
// });

//--------------------------------------------------------------------

/* Here is an example of loading a series of middleware functions at a mount point, with 
a mount path. It illustrates a middleware sub-stack that prints request info for any type 
of HTTP request to the /user/:id path.
*/

// app.use('/user/:id', (req, res, next) => {
//   console.log('Request URL:', req.originalUrl)
//   next()
// }, (req, res, next) => {
//   console.log('Request Type:', req.method)
//   next()
// })

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
/* Route handlers enable you to define multiple routes for a path. The example below 
defines two routes for GET requests to the /user/:id path. The second route will not cause 
any problems, but it will never get called because the first route ends the 
request-response cycle.
*/

//     console.log('ID:', req.params.id)
//     next()
//   }, (req, res, next) => {
//     res.send('User Info')
// });
  
// handler for the /user/:id path, which prints the user ID
// app.get('/user/:id', (req, res, next) => {
//     res.send(req.params.id)
// });

//--------------------------------------------------------------------
/* To skip the rest of the middleware functions from a router middleware stack, 
call next('route') to pass control to the next route. NOTE: next('route') will work only 
in middleware functions that were loaded by using the app.METHOD() or router.METHOD() 
functions.

This example shows a middleware sub-stack that handles GET requests to the /user/:id path.
*/

//--------------------------------------------------------------------

// app.get('/user/:id', (req, res, next) => {
//     // if the user ID is 0, skip to the next route
//     if (req.params.id === '0') next('route')
//     // otherwise pass the control to the next middleware function in this stack
//     else next()
//   }, (req, res, next) => {
//     // send a regular response
//     res.send('regular')
// })
  
// handler for the /user/:id path, which sends a special response
// app.get('/user/:id', (req, res, next) => {
//     res.send('special')
